<h5>BOOK STORE HISTORY</h5>
<p>
    Our first books were created around 500 BC as hand-written scrolls. In the early 16th century, pamphlets were the first printed materials used to share information widely. They were popular in England, France, and Germany, and were frequently used to debate ideas and religious beliefs.  <br> <br>
    Books were first used as a way of recording knowledge, but soon people started to use them to tell stories. People would write down their thoughts on scrolls made from animal skins or papyrus leaves. <br> <br>
    n the Middle Ages, books were hand-copied by monks who would write them out by hand and decorate them with illustrations. This process took months or years to complete a single book. <br> <br>
    In the 1400s, Johannes Gutenberg invented the moveable-type printing press, which made it much easier to produce books because it could print multiple copies at once. Movable type allowed printers to use different fonts and languages on one page. <br> <br>
    <h5>MISSION</h5>
    The purpose of writing a book can vary depending on the author's goals and intentions. Some authors write to educate, some to entertain, while others write to inspire or persuade. Ultimately, the purpose of writing a book is to share a story, idea, or message with readers.12  <br> <br>
