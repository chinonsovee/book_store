            MARILYN Mc Farlane <br>
            Marilyn McFarlane has spent her career writing about far-off lands as a travel writer. Her devout
            Presbyterian upbringing combined with her passion for international travel led to an early interest in world
            religions. Today, her adventures often lead to sacred sites like the Hindu temples in India or the Great
            Mosque in Morocco. When sheâ€™s not traveling the globe, McFarlane lives with her husband, two cats, and many
            books in Portland, Oregon.
